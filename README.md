# circadian_entrainment_of_Nasonia_by_antagonistic_interactions_of_multiple_spectral_inputs

## Project information

This repository contains scripts used to analyze the behavioural data, as publiched in the Royal Society Publishing Proceedings B - Circadian rhythm entrainment of the jewel wasp, Nasonia vitripennis, by antagonistic interactions of multiple spectral inputs (https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2022.2319).

In this project, we examed over 1000 animals under 14 different wavelengths and 4-5 different light intensities. By using a non-linear model, we identified 3 possible circadian photoreceptors for entrainment in Nasonia vitripennis. This results were further investigated with electrophysiology (ERG) experiments as discussed in the manuscript.
